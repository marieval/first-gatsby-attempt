### I´m GatsbyJS --- Nice to meet you.

I just heard about GatsbyJS earlier, but never used it. Now I learned it´s basics and created this sample blog when learning React in the course from Andrei Neagoie on Udemy [The Complete React Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/). 

> I find GatsbyJS interesting and have already some ideas where I could use it: 

  > Perhaps I will create a website with my favourite dishes. 

  > My second thought about using GatsbyJS is log of the places which I recommend for spending holiday.
